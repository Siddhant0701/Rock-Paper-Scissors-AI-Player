# Rock Paper Scissors AI - Predictive Player

Note: This project is still a Work in Progress.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to build an AI application that can play rock-paper scissors and win ~60%-65% of the time. A randomized program can win around ~33% of the time, so the goal is to almost double that rate using `Machine Learning techniques` and algorithms.

Another goal is to build the game such that there is no need to use a keyboard/mouse for the human to input their actions. This can be achieved by using their webcam and anaylzing their gestures using `Computer Vision`.

## Plan
There are 3 possible applications that can be derived from the project:

1. Hand Detection System - A program that is able to detect a hand properly from images or a live stream.
   
2. Rock-Paper-Scissor Classifier - A classifier that is able to differentiate between rock, paper and scissors based on the image alone.
   
3. AI Predictive Player - An AI player that learns from the patterns of someone playing with them and tries to win majority of the time.
