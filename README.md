# rps-model


## Initial Plan
There are 3 possible phases to the project:

1. Hand Detection System - The end goal for this phase is to have a working program that is able to detect a hand properly.
2. Rock-Paper-Scissor Classifier - By the end of this phase, we should have a working classifier that is able to differentiate between rock, paper and scissors based on the camera action alone.
3. AI Predictive Player - Essentially an AI player that learns from the patterns of someone playing with them and tries to win majority of the time.

Confidence intervals and Hypothesis testing can be used to show if the model is actually working statistically better than a model that just chooses an action randomly.
